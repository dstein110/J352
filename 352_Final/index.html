<p>In a comparison of five Big Ten schools, the University of Maryland has the most student athletes from outside the United States. In my study, I compared UMD with Northwestern University, the University of Illinois, the University of Southern California (USC) and the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA). The data represented is from the 2024-2025 academic year, and the full set can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CBazvRJqBx7lM744jdI6p7jalQB1jny3QpyUz1aPA40/edit?usp=sharing" target="blank"><u>here</u></a>. Here are the key observations found in my research.</p>

	<p>As represented by the graph to the left, Maryland has the most international athletes of the sampled schools with 35. Illinois and UCLA both have 20 international athletes, and Northwestern and USC are close with 19. The relative numerical consistency of the four schools not named Maryland suggests the student-athlete population in College Park could be an anomaly. What makes Maryland's total more impressive is the variety of sports that have sizeable international populations. Maryland has four sports with four or more international players, the most of any school.</p>

	<p>Maryland is also the only school of the five to have a double-digit total of international athletes in a single sport. The Maryland men's soccer team has 12 players hailing from outside the United States, the most of any sport across the five schools. The next most international team was UCLA men's soccer with seven foreign players.</p>
<!-- closes right half of the grid -->
</div>

<!-- Main point #2 -->
<h2>The majority of Maryland's international athletes compete in non-revenue sports</h2>

<div class="large-6 medium-6 small-6 cell">
	<p>Maryland has at least one international player in eight different sports, which may sound like a large variety, but actually is the 2nd smallest number of total sports with an foreign-born player. USC has the smallest variety, with an international player on five of its teams. Illinois and UCLA both have nine teams with an international player, and Northwestern has the widest variety with 11 teams.</p>

	<p>Men's soccer is the most international of Maryland's athletic programs with 12 of the 29 players hailing from other countries. That accounts for roughly 41% of the roster. Interestingly enough, Maryland women's tennis has a higher <i>percentage</i> of international players, even though the team has six fewer than men's soccer. This is because of women's tennis' small roster size, which ranged from only 8-10 players across the four colleges in the study who had a team.</p>

	<p>An interesting observation from my research is that the most popular sports at UMD have lower levels of international participation. Football and men's basketball combine for just six international players, just one more than field hockey. It is worth noting that Maryland's four foreign-born football players (Keyari James, Isaac Bunyan, Kevin Kalonji and Alan Herron) is as many as the other four schools combined.</p>

	<p>Nearly one in two men's tennis players in the sampled schools are from outside the U.S. That number moves to one in four for women's tennis players. Men's soccer has a similar rate, reflecting its moniker of 'The World's Game'. Maryland men's soccer coach, <a href="https://umterps.com/sports/mens-soccer/roster/coaches/sasho-cirovski/2636" target= blank><u>Sasho Cirovski</u></a>, an international former player himself who has built a remarkably diverse team in College Park, is familiar with the diversity of soccer.</p>

	<p>Field hockey is another sport with an <a href="https://longstreth.com/pages/history-of-field-hockey?srsltid=AfmBOopIH8Yf3FwhHhN4SKrZZfKqeimMPLWfS3gB5jYYix3gjoZqfnaH" target = blank><u>international</u></a> reputation, although it is worth noting that only two teams in the sample--Maryland and Northwestern-- have field hockey teams. There are 11 international players combined between Northwestern and Maryland, with all but one hailing from Europe. A pluraity of this group comes from the Netherlands, which is no surprise considering the nation's dominance in international field hockey. Last year, the Dutch women's field hockey team <a href="https://www.nbcolympics.com/news/double-dutch-netherlands-womens-field-hockey-wins-second-straight-gold-completes-countrys" target = blank><u>won</u></a> their second-straight gold medal at the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris.</p>
	<p>It is also important to remember that Maryland is the only team among the five schools to have a men's lacrosse team. Maryland has two international players--both from Canada--but more research is needed to determine the the diversity of the sport.</p>

	<p>While there is a large range diversity across the 11 sports studied in the sample, men's and women's sports are close to even in international representation. As demonstrated by the chart on the left, there are slightly more foreign-born male athletes in the sample. There are 61 male international athletes in the sample compared to 52 female international players.</p>

<!-- Main point #4 -->
<h2>International athletes from just five universities cover a significant part of the globe</h2>

<p>45 countries in six continents are represented across the five schools. The majority of international athletes (64) are from Europe, with an additional 22 from North America. The remaining four continents all have single-digit representation, with the next best-represented continent being Africa with nine athletes. Canada supplied the most international athletes of any single country with 20, followed by the UK with 12. Germany, Australia, the Netherlands and Denamrk were the remaining four nations with five or more international athletes. The map below shows the all the countries represented by the five sampled schools.</p>

<p>Today's landscape of college athletics is far different than even a decade ago. In our connected world, college programs are scouting farther and farther from home to find tomorrow's best players. Maryland is at the forefront of this movement, journeying across the world to recruit top collegiate talent.</p>
