	<p>Sofi Stadium is one of the world's most cutting-edge sports venues. Located in Inglewood, California, a suburb of Los Angeles, SoFi stadium is the home of the Los Angeles Rams and Los Angeles Chargers. Both NFL franchises uprooted themselves to play in the new stadium. The Rams spent 20 years in St. Louis before returning to Los Angeles, where they played for nearly 50 years before moving to Missouri. The Chargers 55 years in nearby San Diego before they joined the Rams in LA, a decision that remains controversial.</p>

	<p>SoFi Stadium was built where the Hollywood Park Racetrack, a horseracing venue that first opened in 1938, but closed in 2016. With a capacity of over 70,000, the stadium cost an estimated $5.5 billion, making it the most expensive sports venue ever built. SoFi has already hosted a Super Bowl, ironically won by the hometown Los Angeles Rams. The stadium will host the opening ceremony of the 2028 Summer Olympics.</p>
